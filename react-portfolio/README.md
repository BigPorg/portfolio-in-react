## Considerations

Learning to use React feels like having four different jigsaw puzzles dumped out in front of you, mixed up and tossed together then making a picture out of the ones that work together. </br>
I made my first portfolio in react but had GitHub issues so I had to make a new repository. My tutor and I attempted to get the old one to commit but after several attempts decided it would be best to scrap the old one (https://github.com/BigPorg/PortfolioInReact) and move the files over to a new repo.
